** Association between poor immune function and cancer risk in adult people with HIV following enrollment **

*Introduction*
Study Population: The analytic study population consisted of adults (>18 years old) living with HIV (PWH) who were enrolled in the study.

*Exposure Definition*

The primary exposure in this study was poor immune function, defined by:

AIDS-defining illness (ADI): A history of any condition classified as an AIDS-defining illness, such as certain cancers, opportunistic infections, or other serious HIV-related conditions.

CD4 count less than 200 cells/mmB3: A CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mmB3 prior to enrollment, reflecting advanced immune suppression.

The exposure was further stratified by viral suppression status at enrollment:

Viral suppression: Defined as having a viral load of less than 200 copies/mL at the time of enrollment.

No viral suppression: Defined as having a viral load of 200 copies/mL or higher.
